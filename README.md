# Coding-Quiz

## Description

The purpose of this project was to build a program that quizzes the user on their knowledge of Front-End Web Development.

Through this project, I learnt a lot about Javascript, and how to ensure a program's logic is as sharp as possible.

## Installation

N/A, a web browser will do.

## Usage

To use the program, click on the 'Start' button after reading the instructions. Answer the questions that follow using the buttons provided. After answering all questions, or running out of time, the quiz will end.

Your score will be displayed, and you have the option to save your initials as well as your score.

In the top left, clicking the link named 'View Highscores' will allow you to view the last saved score.
